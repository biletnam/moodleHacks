# moodleHacks
Moodle is a fantastic project, but (for obvious security and stability reasons) it let the teacher/professor role few ways to increase or modify its functionality over moodle instances installed by organizations.
This repository contains few snippets of code that have been used to modify Moodle appearance or functionality (using XSS to add our HTML, CSS y JS code).

## Installation
The snippets of code are distributed as .js files but just because they mainly incldude JavaScript code. They are really HTML snippet of code that include eerything they need (HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript).
To install it, you just need to copy this snppets of code and adapt them (if required) to your Moodle instance or other LMS. After that, just introduce it in the rich/HTML area. It doesn't matter if you do it in the title or description fields (if description is showed, of course). What it is requiered is to inlude the text in the "plain HTML view". To get this view, sometimes you need sometimes to click the "see more options button" and later the "HTML" button. This configuration depends on the LMS version.

### Note
This code has been created to work with the Moodle instance adapted and installed by the Universidad de Extremadura. So, to use it with other moodle environments, some changes would be required.
